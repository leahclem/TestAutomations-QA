Portfolio for Software Test Automations &amp; QA class work


    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    
Starting with writing unit tests that verify the functionality of the code and test each unit in isolation. Also testing usability by employing user test cases to ensure that navigation of the program is intuitive. 

    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    
The average user will make mistakes when using any program. It is important to predict the bulk of those mistakes and create responses that will guide the user to input the correct data. Error messages should inform the user of the mishap that took place and instruct on how to remedy it.  

    How do I approach designing software?

I approach my design by anticipating the tests that I will need to perform and formatting my program in a way that will be easy to verify and modify functionality.
